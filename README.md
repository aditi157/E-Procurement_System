# E-Procurement Platform – Vision Document

## Project Name & Overview
**Project Name:** E-Procurement Platform  

This is a web-based e-procurement platform designed to digitize and streamline an organization’s internal purchasing process. The system enables employees to request items, managers to review and approve requests, vendors to fulfill orders, and finance teams to track invoice payments through a single, centralized platform.

## Problem It Solves
In many organizations, procurement is handled through manual processes such as emails, spreadsheets, and paper forms. These methods are time-consuming, error-prone, and lack transparency. Employees have limited visibility into request status, managers struggle to track approvals, and finance teams face difficulties reconciling orders and invoices. This project addresses these issues by providing a structured and traceable digital procurement workflow.
